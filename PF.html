    <p>As you can see, I have a pretty nice taste in food. Aside from the <em>Chicken Parmesan</em>, I really like
    to eat finger food. Foods like french fries and burgers always are more easily accessible when you're 
    hungry. Yet, a good bowl of noodles or a plate of rainbow trout never hurts. You may have also been pleased
    by my selection of artists. Out of the ones listed my favorite is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)">Drake.</a>
    However, I admire J.Cole the most because of how humble he is and the lessons he teaches in his music.
